# Color-Scheme-Generator
The Color scheme generator is a tool which can be used by UI designers or frontend developers to get a good color scheme for your project. Click on the color input which is set to red by default to pick a new color then click on the "get color scheme" button to generate the color scheme for your chosen color. You could also click on the drop-down to choose a different scheme e.g "monotonic".
